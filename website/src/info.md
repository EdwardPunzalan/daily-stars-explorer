# Project Description

This project started as a way to experiment with techs that I hadn't used much.  
I was also curious to see the current trend of stars more than the cumulative stars count history only and that proved to be a good and not yet much explored ideas for a project.
I also wanted to build something E2E without incurring in any cost, and have something to give me the motivation to go on.

Most of the things implemented here can be introduced by GitHub at any time.

I'm not considering the stars a sole indicator of a repo's quality, they can be bought and projects who are more active on social medias can show a high star count for the promoting activity.

The number of stars a GitHub project receives does not always directly correlate with its quality, usefulness, or significance. Several factors can contribute to a project receiving a high number of stars, even if it's not particularly good or useful:

- **Popularity contests**: Sometimes, projects gain stars simply because they become popular due to factors like marketing, promotion, or being featured in articles, blogs, or social media posts. This popularity can snowball, leading to more stars, even if the project itself may not offer substantial value.
- **Trendiness**: Projects related to trendy technologies, buzzwords, or topics may attract attention and stars, regardless of their actual quality or usefulness. For example, projects related to blockchain, artificial intelligence, or cryptocurrency may receive a significant number of stars due to the hype surrounding these fields.
- **Novelty**: Projects that introduce novel or unique ideas, even if they are not particularly useful in practice, may attract attention and stars simply because they are different. However, novelty does not always translate to long-term usefulness or sustainability.
- **Community support**: Projects with active and engaged communities may accumulate stars through contributions, feedback, and endorsements from community members. Even if the project itself is not outstanding, a supportive community can drive its popularity and star count.
- **Historical significance**: Some projects may have gained stars over time due to their historical significance or influence on subsequent projects, even if they are outdated or no longer actively maintained. These projects may serve as references or inspirations for newer projects, leading to continued star accumulation.
- **Unbiased evaluation**: Users may star projects for reasons unrelated to their quality or usefulness, such as personal preferences, curiosity, or experimentation. This can lead to inflated star counts for projects that may not deserve them based on objective criteria.

Comsidering all of those what you get is the trendiness of the repo, that can be sometime related to the actual popularity and quality.
So especially when doing things like in the [Compare](https://emanuelef.github.io/daily-stars-explorer/#/compare) feature

Awesome lists tend to accumulate a high number of GitHub stars, and one reason behind this phenomenon could be the perception of stars as bookmarks. Users might star repositories with the intention of revisiting them later for reference or exploration. Additionally, the sheer number of stars often acts as a social signal, prompting more users to star the repository, thus perpetuating the cycle of popularity.

In summary, while the number of stars a GitHub project receives can serve as an indicator of its popularity and visibility within the community, it should not be the sole factor considered when evaluating its quality or usefulness. It's essential to assess projects based on their features, documentation, code quality, community engagement, and ongoing maintenance to determine their true value.

- Use SSE
- React
- E2E Cloud Solution using a Cloud provider (OCI since is free)
- Timeseries analysis and trend prediction

So if this is still doing something relevant I'm glad is useful to others.
